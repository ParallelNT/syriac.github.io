		          <a class="big">G</a>eorge M. Lamsa (August 5, 1892 - September 22, 1975) was born in a small village called Marbishu (Mar Behishu) which was located in the Kurdish mountains at the corner of southeast Turkey.

           His elementary education was at a small Presbyterian School and his secondary and post secondary education 
           was at the Archbishop of Canterburyâ€™s Mission to Assyrian Christians school. He distinguished himself through 
           his excellent work and good grades and as a result was able to get a job as a teacher. After a few years of 
           teaching, he moved to a new school opened in Van (Turkey). He had to move around a number of times in response
            to the persecution of the Armenians which led up to the impeding collapse of the Ottoman empire and the 
            start of World War One. 
            <br/><br/>
            Finally in 1913, he had to flee local authorities in Istanbul who were sent to 
            the University where he was employed. He traveled to Bulgaria and Italy and finally ended up Buenos Aires,
             Argentina. In 1917, he earned enough money to emigrated to New York City. In 1919, he earned a scholarship 
             to the Episcopal Theological Seminary in Virginia, where he studied for three years.

	                He then moved to Washington D.C., where, he assisted the Archbishop of Canterbury raise funds for 
	                the reconstruction of war-damaged schools in Turkey. In 1923, Lamsa was able to print his first book 
	                "The Secret of the Near East" this helped to promote his work with the Archbishop of Canterbury's mission 
	                in Turkey.  His second book, "The Oldest Christian People" which was co-authored by William Chauncey 
	                Emhardt was published in 1926.  William Chauncey Emhardt was the head of the Missions Committee of 
	                the Episcopal Church in the United States. Lamsa traveled and spoke promoting the cause of the 
	                Christians in the East through the Association Assyrian St. Ephram which was a group organized to 
	                raise money for the Christian refugees as a result of World War One.

                 It was supported by the American 
	                Protestant Episcopal Church. Through various private donors, between 1927 and 1930, he was able to publish 
	                his third book, entitled "My Neighbor Jesus". Shortly thereafter, he started to translate "The Four
	                 Gospels According to the Eastern Version". He finished and published the four Gospels in 1933. It 
	                 was published by the A.J Holman Publishing Company which was located in Philadelphia.

	                  Lamsa 
	                 continued to lecture at various churches. Through these lectures, he gained a number of 
	                 benefactors that supported him regularly throughout his publishing, writing and translation 
	                 career. He finished and published the entire New Testament in 1940. In the autumn of 1940, 
	                 he began to translation the Old Testament. Lamsa was a student at Dropsie College of Hebrew
	                  and Cognate Learning between 1944-1945 but never received a degree. In 1957, when the entire 
	                  Bible was published, his lecturing schedule greatly increased. He soon was spending much of his 
	                  time giving radio interviews, speaking and traveling. 
	                  <br/><br/>
	                  Lamsa believed in the ecumenical Christian 
	                  Church and accepted any and all invitations to speak. He also tried to promote greater cooperation
	                   and understanding between Christians, Jews and Moslems. He died on September 22, 1975.
