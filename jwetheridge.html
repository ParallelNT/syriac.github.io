          <h2>Childhood & Ministry:</h2><p class="lead">
           He was the third of seven children. He received most of his early education from his father who was master of an academy of Portsea.
             Though he never attended any university he acquired ultimately a thorough knowledge of Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Syriac, 
             French and German.  In 1824 he was placed on the Wesleyan Methodist plan as a local preacher. 
             <br/><br/>
              In 1827 his offer to enter the ministry was accepted, and after the usual probationary trial he was received into full
               connexion at the conference of 1831.  He married Eliza Middleton in that same year. For two years after this he remained at Brighton, 
               and in 1833 he removed to Cornwall, being stationed successively at the Truro and Falmouth circuits. From Falmouth he 
               removed to Darlaston, where in 1838 his health gave way.

	               <p class="lead">
	                For a good many years he was a supernumerary, 
	               and lived for a while at Caen and Paris, where in the public libraries he found great facilities for 
	               prosecuting his favorite subject which was Oriental studies.  His health having considerably improved, 
	               he became, in 1843, pastor of the Methodist church at Boulogne.  He returned to England in 1847, and was
	                appointed successively to the circuits of Islington, Bristol, Leeds, Penzance, Penryn, Truro and St Austell 
	                in east Cornwall.  Shortly after his return to England he received the degree of Ph.D. from the university
	                 of Heidelberg.  He was a patient, modest, hard-working and accurate scholar.
