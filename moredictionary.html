                        <h2>Abgar</h2>
                        <p class="mb-0">
                        a name or title borne by a line of kings or toparchs, apparently twenty-nine in number, who reigned in Osrhoene and had their capital it Edessa about the time of the Christian era. According to an old tradition, one of these princes, perhaps Abgar V. (Ukkama or Uchomo, " the black "), being afflicted with leprosy, sent a letter to Jesus, acknowledging his divinity, craving his help and offering him an asylum in his own residence, but Jesus wrote a letter declining to go, promising, however, that after his ascension he would send one of his disciples. These letters are given by Eusebius (Eccl. Hist. i. 13), who declares that the Syriac document from which he translates them had been preserved in the archives at Edessa from the time of Abgar. Eusebius also states that in due course Judas, son of Thaddaeus, was sent (in 340= A.D. 29). In another form of the story, de-rived from Moses of Chorene, it is said further that Jesus sent his portrait to Abgar, and that this existed in Edessa (Hist. Armen., ed. W. Whiston, ii. 29-32). Yet another version is found in the Syriac Doctrina Addaei (Addaeus = Thaddaeus), edited by G. Phillips (1876). Here it is said that the reply of Jesus was given not in writing, but verbally, and that the event took place in 343 (A.D. 32). Greek forms of the legend are found in tale Acta Thaddaei (C. Tischendorf, Acta apostolorutx apocr. 261 ff.). These stories have given rise to much discussion. The testimony of Augustine and Jerome is to the effect that Jesus wrote nothing. The correspondence was rejected as apocryphal by Pope Gelasius and a Roman Synod (c. 495), though, it is true.. this view has not been shared universally by the Roman churck (Tillemont, Memoires, i. 3, pp. 990 ff.). Amongst Evangelicals the spuriousness of the letters is almost generally admitted. Lipsius (Die Edessenische Abgarsage, 1880) has pointed out anachronisms which seem to indicate that the story is quite unhistorical. The first king of Edessa of whom we have any trustworthy information is Abgar VIII., bar Ma'nu (A.D. 176-213). It is suggested that the legend arose from a desire to trace the christianizing of his kingdom to an apostolic source. Eusebius gives the legend in its oldest form; it was worked up in the Doctrina Addaei in the second half of the 4th century; and Moses of Chorene was dependent upon both these sources.

                        <p class="mb-0">
                        (according to Acts i. 19, "the field of blood "), the name given to the field purchased by Judas Iscariot with the money he received for the betrayal of Jesus Christ. A different version is given in Matthew xxvii. 8, where Judas is said to have cast down the money in the Temple, and the priests who had paid it to have recovered the pieces, with which they bought " the potter's field, to bury strangers in." The MS. evidence is greatly in favour of a form Aceldamach. This would seem to mean " the field of thy blood," which is unsuitable. Since, however, we find elsewhere one name appearing as both Sirach and Sira (ch = Hebrew Aleph), Aceldamach may be another form of an original Aceldama (Hebrew), the "field of blood." A. Klostermann, however, takes the ch to be part of the Aramaic root demach, " to sleep "; the word would then mean "field of sleep " or cemetery (Probleme im Aposteltexte, 1-8, 1883), an explanation which fits in well with the account in Matthew xxvii. The traditional site (now Hak el-Dum), S. of Jerusalem on the N.E. slope of the "Hill of Evil Counsel" (Jebel Deir Abu Tor), was used as a burial-place for Christian pilgrims from the 6th century A.D. till as late, apparently, as 1697, and especially in the time of the Crusades. Near it there is a very ancient charnel- house, partly rock-cut, partly of masonry, said to be the work of Crusaders.

                        <h2>Aramaean</h2>
                        <p class="mb-0">
                        (Hebrew Aram, Greek Syroi, Syri. AV 'Syrians' and 'Syria'). รณ In Gn lO:22-23 Aram is the son of Shem, and father of Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash, the last of which is Arabia Petraea, the Mas of the cuneiform inscriptions (cf. Gn 25:14). In Gn 22^' Aram is the son of Kemuel, the son of Nahor, the two elder brothers of Kemuel being Uz (AV Huz) and Buz (Bazu in the Assyr. texts). In the OT Aram includes the northern part of Mesopotamia, Syria as far south as the borders of Pal., and the larger part of Arabia Petraea. The inhabitants of this region were mainly of Sem. origin, and spoke a Sem. language, which, with its dialects, is known as Aramaic. In some parts of it, however, as at Kadesh on the Orontes, near the lake of Homs, and at Carchemish (now Jerablus or Jerabis) on the Euphrates, the Hittites had occupied the country; and on the eastern bank of the Euphrates, in the neighbourhood of Carchemish, the powerful kingdom of Mitanni was established, with a language of a very peculiar type. An Aram. dialect was spoken by the Nabataeans of Petra, and it is probable that the Ishmaelite tribes must be classed as Aramaeans. In the Assyr. inscriptions the name appears as Aramu, Arumu, and Arimu, as well as Arma. In a text of Tiglath-pileser I. (B.C. 1100) the waters on the east side of the Euphrates and westward of Harran are termed mami mat Arma, 'the waters of the land of the Aramaeans.' Assurnazir-pal III. (B.C. 883-823) states that he restored to Assyria certain cities which a former Assyr. king had fortified in the land of Nahri, towards the sources of the Tigris and Euphrates, and of which the 'Arumu ' had taken possession. Among the Aramaean princes whom he subdued here were Ammi-baal and Bur-Hadad, i.e. Bar-Hadad or Ben-Hadad. There were many Aramaean tribes in Babylonia (Pukuduor Pekod, Nabatu or Nabataeans, Ru'ua, etc.) who lived under sheikhs on the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates as well as on the coast of the Persian Gulf. They were partly traders, partly pastoral nomads, and were collectively called Arumu. The Assyrians never gave the name to the populations westward of the Euphrates, who were included under the general titles of Hittites and Amorites. In the OT, on the contrary, the name is applied to the inhabitants of Syria as well as to those of Mesopotamia. The different Araniisan districts or states are distinguished by special titles. Mesopotamia is known as Aram-naharaim, 'Aram of the two rivers,' Tigris and Euphrates. It corresponds in part to the Nahrima of the Egyp. inscriptions, though tlie latter term denoted the district between the Euphrates and Orontes, as well as the kingdom of Mitanni on the eastern side of the Euphrates. In the Tel el-Amarna tablets, however, it is confined to Mitanni. The Assyr. country of Nahri lay in a different direction, in the mountains of S. Armenia. Cushan-rishathaim, king of Aram-naharaim (AV Mesopotamia), who oppressed the Israelites for eight years shortly after their entrance into Canaan (Jg 3:8-10), was a king of Mitanni. We learn from the Tel el-Amarna tablets that in the 15th cent. B.C. the kings of Mitanni or 'Nahrima' had already interfered in the affairs of Palestine, and had intermarried with the royal family of Egypt. The troops of Mitanni accompanied the northern hordes who attacked Egypt in the reign of Ramses m. (c. B.C. 1200); and as the king of Mitanni is not named among the conquered invaders, it is probable that he did not actually enter Egypt, but remained behind in Canaan. This would have been just before the Israelitish conquest of that country, and would throw light on the presence there of Cushan-rishathaim. In certain passages of the Pent. assumed to belong to P (Gn 25:20, 28:2 and v. 5-7, 31:18, 33:18, 35:9, 26 48:7), the name of Aram-naharaim as applied to the northern part of Mesopotamia is replaced by Pad[d]an-aram, of which S'deh 'Aram, 'the field of Aram,' in Hos 12:12, is supposed to be a translation. Paddan is the same word as the Syr. and Arab. paddan, a measure of land which can be 'ploughed' by oxen in a day, and is found in Assyrian under the form of paddanu. Padanu is explained in the cuneiform lexical tablets as meaning 'field' or 'garden' {WAI ii. 62. 33), from a root which signifies to 'cleave' or 'plough' the ground. It is also brought into connexion with kharrdnu, 'a high-road,' whence the name of Harran (Gn 11:31, 28:10, 27:43), and is the equivalent of a Sumerian word signifying 'foot' or 'plain,' which was used to denote 'the land of the Amorites' {WAI ii. 50. 59). An early king of Babylonia, Agu-kak-rimi (c. B.C. 1700) calls himself 'king of Padan and Alman.' On the western side of the Euphrates the Aramaean states and language extended, eastward of the Jordan, as far south as Mizpeh in Gilead (Gn 31:47, where the cairn is described as forming a boundary between the languages of Aram and Canaan). In the north was Aram of Zobah (the Tsubite of the Assyr. texts, which place it eastward of Hamath). In the time of Saul (1 Sam 14:47) 'the kings of Zobah' are mentioned, but soon afterwards Zobah appears under the sole rule of Hadadezer, son of Rehob (2 Sam 8:1-12). Hadadezer, who had 'had wars' with Hamath, was defeated by David 'as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.' Subsequently, in spite of assistance from the Aramaeans of Damascus (2 Sam 8:5), and of Mesopotamia 'beyond' the Euphrates (2 Sam 10:14), the army of Hadadezer was again overthrown at Helam (perhaps Aleppo, Assyr. Khalman), and 'the kings that were servants to Hadadezer' became the vassals of Israel. Josephus transforms the place Helam, which he calls Khalaman, into a prince of Mesopotamia. Among the cities of Hadadezer captured by David were Tibhath (1 Ch 18:8, called Betah in 2 Sam 8:8) and Berothai (Cun in 1 Ch 18:8). Tibhath seems to be the Tubikh of the Tel el-Amarna tablets and the geographical list of Tahutmes III. at Karnak, the Tebah of Gn 22:24. The whole district is probably that which is termed Nukhasse in the Tel el-Amarna texts (Anaugas in the Egyp. inscriptions). Adjoining Aram-Zobah was Aram Beth-rehob or Aram-rehob (2 Sam 10:4, 8), which may have derived its name from the father (or ancestor) of Hadadezer. Rehob is associated with Ish-tob, 'the men of Tob' (see Jg 11:3, 5); but in 1 Ch 19:6 Aram-naharaim takes the place of both. To the south came Aram-maacah or Maacah, which, along with the adjoining Geshur, Avas assigned to Manasseh, eastward of the lakes of Merom and Gennesaret (Dt 3:14, Jos 12:5, 13:11,13, 2 S 3:3, 13:37). Like Tebah and Tahash, the Takhis of the Egyp. monuments, Maacah was a descendant of Nahor (Gn 22:24). Between Maacah and Zobah was the city of Damascus (As.Dimaska) which was conquered by the Egyp. king Tahutmes III. (B.C. 1480), and was still subject to Egypt in the age of the Tel el-Amarna tablets (B.C. 1400). Damascus is called Aram-Dammesek in 2 S 8:6, when it sent aid to Hadadezer. The defeat of Hadadezer made it tributary to David, but it recovered its independence early in the reign of Solomon under Rezon the son of Eliadah, who had been a vassal of the king of Zobah (1 K 11:23, 25). Damascus soon became a dangerous neighbour of the northern kingdom of Israel, and at one time even exercised a sort of suzerainty over Samaria. The other Aramaean states of Syria were absorbed by it, so that eventually the name of Aram was applied to it alone; but its power was finally shattered by the Assyrians. Foremost among the Aram.Tan deities was Hadad or Addu (also Dadu or Dadda), the sungod, identified by the Assyrians Avith their Ramman (Rimmon), the airgod, also called Amurru, 'the Amorite.' We find the combination Hadad-Rimmon in Zec 12:11. By the side of Hadad stood his divine son Ben-Hadad, as we learn from the cuneiform inscriptions. At Sendschirli mention is made, besides Hadad, of Resheph the fire-god, of El, Shamas, Or, and Rekeb-el or Rekub-el, which may possibly denote 'the chariot of El.' Numerous deities are referred to in the Palmyrene inscriptions, such as Baal-samen, Aglibol, and Yarkhi-bol ; but several of them, like Bol, or Nebo, or Sin the moon-god of Harran, were borrowed from the Babylonian. So also was the goddess Atar, the Bab. Istar, who, in combination with the Syrian 'Ati, produced the hybrid Atargatis. In the south the Nabataeans of Tenia, Petra, and the Sinaitic Peninsula had several deities of their own, such as Aumos(?), Katsiu (Kassios), and Zelem (As. Zalmu); but others, like Dusares and Allftt, Manot, Kais, and Kaisah, they shared with the Arabs. The gods of Syria are mentioned in Jg 10:6.

                        <h2>Amen</h2>
                        <p class="mb-0">
                        a Hebrew word, of which the root meaning is "stability," generally adopted in Christian worship as a concluding formula for prayers and hymns. Three distinct biblical usages may be noted. (a) Initial Amen, referring back to words of another speaker, e.g. I Kings i. 36; Rev. xxii. 20. (b) Detached Amen, the complementary sentence being suppressed, e.g. Neh. v. 13.; Rev. v. 14 (cf. 1 Cor. xiv. 16). (c) Final Amen, with no change of speaker, as in the subscription to the first three divisions of the Psalter and in the frequent doxologies of the New Testament Epistles. The uses of amen (" verily ") in the Gospels form a peculiar class; they are initial, but often lack any backward reference. Jesus used the word to affirm his own utterances, not those of another person, and this usage was adopted by the church. The liturgical use of the word in apostolic times is attested by the passage from I Cor. cited above, and Justin Martyr (c. A.D. 150) describes the congregation as responding "amen" to the benediction after the celebration of the Eucharist. Its introduction into the baptismal formula (in the Greek Church it is pronounced after the name of each person of the Trinity) is probably later. Among certain Gnostic sects Amen became the name of an angel, and in post-biblical Jewish works exaggerated statements are multiplied as to the right method and the bliss of pronouncing it. It is still used in the service of the synagogue, and the Mahommedans not only add it, after reciting the first Sura of the Koran, but also when writing letters, &c., and repeat it three times, often with the word Qimtir, as a kind of talisman.

A'MEN (Hebrew AMN), literally, "firm, true;" and, used as a substantive, "that which is true," "truth" (Is. Ixv. 16); a word used in strong asseverations, fixing as it were the stamp of truth upon the assertion which it accompanied, and making it binding a,s an oath (comp. Num. v. 22). In the LXX. of 1 Chr. xvi. 36, Neh. v. 13, viii. 6, the word appears in the form 'Amen, which is used throughout the N. T. In other passages the Heb. is rendered by genoito, except in Is. lxv. 16. The Vulgate adopts the Hebrew word in all cases except in the Psalms, where it is translated fiat. In Deut. xxvii. 15-26, the people were to say "Amen," as the Levites pronounced each of the curses upon Mount Ebal, signifying by this their assent to the conditions under which the curses would be inflicted. In accordance with this usage we find that, among the Rabbins, "Amen" involves the ideas of swearing, acceptance, and truthfulness. The first two are illustrated by the passages already quoted; the last by 1 K. i. 30; John iii. 3, 5, 11 (A.V. "verily"), in which the assertions are made with the solemnity of an oath, and then strengthened by the repetition of "Amen." "Amen" was the proper response of the person to whom an oath was administered (Neh. v. 13, viii. 6; 1 Chr. xvi. 36; Jer. xi. 5, marg.); and the Deity, to whom appeal is made on such occasions, is called "the God of Amen" (Is. lxv. 16), as being a witness to the sincerity of the implied compact. With a similar significance Christ is called "the Amen., the faithful and true witness" (Rev. iii. 14; comp. John i. 14, xiv. 6; 2 Cor. i. 20). It is matter of tradition that in the Temple the "Amen" was not uttered by the people, but that, instead, at the conclusion of the priest's prayers, they responded, "Blessed be the name of the glory of his kingdom for ever and ever." Of this a trace is supposed to remain in the concluding sentence of the Lord's Prayer (comp. Rom. xi. 36). But in the synogogues and private houses it was customary for the people or members of the family who were present to say "Amen" to the prayers which were offered by the minister or the master of the house, and the custom remained in the early Christian church (Matt. vi. 13; 1 Cor. xiv. 10). And not only public prayers, but those offered in private, and doxologies, were appropriately concluded with "Amen" (Rom. ix. 5, xi. 36, xv. 33, xvi. 27; 2 Cor. xiii. 14 (13), &c).

                       (Gr. Barbaros), the name among the early Greeks for all foreigners. The word is probably onomatopoetic, designed to represent the uncouth babbling of which languages other than their own appeared to the Greeks to consist. Even the Romans were included in the term. The word soon assumed an evil meaning, becoming associated with the vices and savage natures of which they believed their enemies to be possessed. The Romans adopted the word for all peoples other than those under Graeco-Roman influence and domination. It has long become synonymous with a general lack of civilization.

                        <h2>Barabbas</h2>
                        <p class="mb-0">
                        The Greek form of the name (Gr.)Barabbas represents the Aramaic Bar-abba = 'son of the teacher' or 'of the master.' The name is not rare in the Talm. (Lightfoot, Hor. Hebr. on Mt 27:16), and one instance indicates that Abba may sometimes have been a proper name. Renan (Vie de Jesus, p. 406) prefers Bar-rabban (the form preserved in the Harclean Syr.), which would mean 'son of a Rabbi.' So also Ewald. All four evangelists mention Barabbas as the criminal whom the hierarchy urged the multitude to demand in preference to Jesus Christ, whom Pilate offered to release in honour of the Passover. We are told that Barabbas was 'a notable prisoner' (Mt 27:16), 'who for a certain insurrection made in the city, and for murder' (Lk 23:19), 'was lying bound with them that had made insurrection' (Mk 15:7), and that he was a 'robber' or brigand (Jn 18:40). He may have been connected with the two 'robbers' who were crucified with Jesus; but we cannot be sure that the (Gr) stasiastai of Mk 15:7 include the two robbers. The (Gr) stasis, or 'insurrection,' in which Barabbas took part was perhaps a looting of houses rather than a popular uprising. 
The name 'Jesus' before that of Barabbas in Mt 27:16,17 is an interesting reading found in a few cursives, in the Armenian Version, and in some copies of the Jerusalem Syriac. With this insertion Pilate's question runs thus: 'Whom will ye that I release unto you? Jesus Barabbas, or Jesus which is called Christ?' This reading was known to Origen; and he does not condemn it, although he thinks that the many MSS which omit the 'Jesus' are probably right. Ewald (Life of Christ, p. 241), Renan (Vie de Jesus, p. 406), Trench (Studies in the Gospels, p. 296), and others defend the reading ; and Meyer conjectures that the common name suggested the substitution of one Jesus for another. But the reading is rejected by all the best critics. It would be amazing that the true reading should be lost from all uncials, nearly all cursives, and all the more ancient versions. The words of Jerome, ad loc, do not necessarily imply that 'Jesus Barabbas' was the reading in the Gospel according to the Hebrews. He says : Iste en evangelio quod scribitur juxta Hebraeos filius magistri eorum interpretatur; which may mean that this document contained the words, 'Barabbas, which being interpreted is, Son of their Master.' But if the Gospel according to the Hebrews had 'Jesus, Son of their Master' for 'Jesus Barabbas,' then this may be the source from which the name 'Jesus' got into some copies of St. Matthew. If the name was not in the Gospel according to the Hebrews, then we may adopt Tregelles' conjecture, that the interpolation arose first in v. 17 through accidental repetition of the last two letters of (Gr.)nuir, the second IN being afterwards interpreted as an abbreviation of 'Insoun. The copies known to Origen seem to have had the (Gr.) 'Insoun in v.17 only. That Barabbas had this name, and that the evangelists missed the startling coincidence, is not probable.
